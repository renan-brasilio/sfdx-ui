        Validates the deleted metadata and runs all Apex tests, but prevents the deletion from being saved to the org.
        <br/><br/>
        If you change a field type from Master-Detail to Lookup or vice versa, that change isn’t supported when using the --checkonly parameter to test a deletion (validation). This kind of change isn’t supported for test deletions to avoid the risk of data loss or corruption. If a change that isn’t supported for test deletions is included in a deletion package, the test deletion fails and issues an error.
        <br/><br/>
        If your deletion package changes a field type from Master-Detail to Lookup or vice versa, you can still validate the changes prior to deploying to Production by performing a full deletion to another test Sandbox. A full deletion includes a validation of the changes as part of the deletion process.
        <br/><br/>
        Note: A Metadata API deletion that includes Master-Detail relationships deletes all detail records in the Recycle Bin in the following cases.
        <br/><br/>
        1. For a deletion with a new Master-Detail field, soft delete (send to the Recycle Bin) all detail records before proceeding to delete the Master-Detail field, or the deletion fails. During the deletion, detail records are permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and cannot be recovered.
        <br/><br/>
        2. For a deletion that converts a Lookup field relationship to a Master-Detail relationship, detail records must reference a master record or be soft-deleted (sent to the Recycle Bin) for the deletion to succeed. However, a successful deletion permanently deletes any detail records in the Recycle Bin.
